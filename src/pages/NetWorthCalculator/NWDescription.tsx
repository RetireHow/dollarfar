          What is Net Worth?

          <p>
            The net worth of an individual or company constitutes the total
            assets owned by them. In other words, net worth can also be
            described as the total value of all the assets owned minus the total
            value of all the liabilities.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5">
            A net worth calculator is a tool that helps to determine the net
            worth of an individual or company, based on certain inputs. These
            inputs include the total value of all the assets and the total value
            of all the liabilities.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5">
            An efficient net worth calculator can even ask for inputs
            specifically for different types of assets like the value of shares
            and equity, property, gold and jewellery, cash and bank accounts,
            etc. or the various types of liabilities like home loans, personal
            loans, income tax owned, credit card dues, etc.

          How to Calculate Net Worth
        </h3>
        <div className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px]">
          <p>
            The net worth can be calculated for any company, group, individual
            using a simple formula. Every individual or company owns resources
            that are either responsible for bringing in financial benefit for
            them or drain it out.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5">
            Hence, the difference between the total value of assets and
            liabilities yields the net worth. The formula for calculating the
            net worth is mentioned ahead in detail. With the help of it, you can
            calculate the net worth of any individual or company provided that
            you have the relevant information about their assets and
            liabilities.

          Net Worth Calculation Formula
        </h3>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px]">
          The measurement of net worth is based on a simple formula that
          includes the total value of assets and the total value of liabilities
          of an individual or company.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Net Worth Calculation Formula is as stated below:
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-black mt-5">
          Net worth = [Value of Asset 1 + Value of Asset 2 + Value of Asset 3 +
          Value of Asset N] - [Value of Liability 1 + Value of Liability 2 +
          Value of Liability 3 + Value of Liability N]
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Let us understand this formula in detail:
        </p>

        <div className="text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              <span className="text-black font-bold mx-1">Assets:</span>
              <span className="text-[#696969]">
                While calculating the net worth, all the sources of income or
                ways that yield a financial benefit will fall under the category
                of an asset. This can include resources such as a property,
                rented home, shares, etc.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="text-black font-bold mx-1">Liabilities:</span>
              <span className="text-[#696969]">
                Contrary to assets, liabilities are all such sources that result
                in the drain of financial resources. These can either be basic
                necessities or pleasure-giving materialistic things. Ideally,
                liabilities can include fees, taxes, loans, etc.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
            Hence summing up all the assets as well as the liabilities
            separately and then calculating the difference between them will
            ultimately yield the net worth of an individual or company.

          Net Worth Calculation Example
        </h3>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Now that we know the formula for calculating net worth, let us
          understand it more clearly with the help of an example.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Let us consider that Mr. A is a businessman who owns a bunch of assets
          and liabilities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Here is the list of all the assets that he owns and their value.
        </p>

        <ul className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5 list-disc list-inside">
          <li> Rented Property: Rs 5,00,000</li>
          <li> Shares and Funds: Rs 7,00,000</li>
          <li> Farming Land: Rs 15,00,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Whereas, here are all the liabilities that Mr. A owns and their
          respective values.
        </p>

        <ul className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5 list-disc list-inside">
          <li> Outstanding Loan: Rs 4,50,000</li>
          <li> A tax due: Rs 1,25,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Using the formula mentioned above to calculate the net worth of Mr. A,
          here is what we can derive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Net Worth of Mr. A = [5,00,000 + 7,00,000 + 15,00,000] - [4,50,000 +
          1,25,000] = Rs 21,25,000
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          Hence, as of today, the total net worth of Mr. A will be Rs 21,25,000.
          This is how to calculate the net worth of a person.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#696969] text-[18px] leading-[27px] mt-5">
          However, the net worth does not remain the same and keeps on
          fluctuating. It can be assumed that five years later Mr. A has added
          more assets and liabilities to his portfolio or vice versa. In such a
          case, the net worth of Mr. A might increase or decrease five years
          later depending on his assets and liabilities.
